This Event Management System is designed to streamline event planning and coordination by offering a user-friendly interface and robust backend support. The platform enables users to register and log in securely using JWT authentication, ensuring data privacy and access control. With real-time WebSocket integration, users receive instant updates on event changes, making collaboration seamless. The system allows event organizers to add event details, set schedules, update event information, and delete events as needed.

The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, efficiently handles API requests and interacts with MongoDB, ensuring smooth data management. The frontend, built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, delivers a modern and responsive experience for users. Additionally, the application includes error handling, form validation, and loading states for enhanced usability.

To set up the project locally, clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and configure the .env file with database credentials. Start the development server using npm start for both frontend and backend. For deployment, services like Netlify, Vercel, and Render can be used to make the platform accessible online.

This project serves as a practical solution for event management, catering to organizations, businesses, and individuals looking to efficiently manage their events. Future improvements may include calendar integration, payment gateway support, and AI-powered event recommendations. Contributions, issue reporting, and feedback are highly encouraged to enhance the system further. ðŸš€
